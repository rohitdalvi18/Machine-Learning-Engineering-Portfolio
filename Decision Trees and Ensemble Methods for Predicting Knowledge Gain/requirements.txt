Goals
- To understand the relationship between web search behavior and knowledge gain through exploratory data analysis
- To implement a decision tree classifier from scratch to predict knowledge gain
- To apply ensemble methods (Random Forest and Boosting) to improve prediction performance
- To analyze and compare the performance of different models

Background

- The SAL-Lightning dataset contains features extracted from web pages visited by users during learning tasks, along with measurements of their knowledge gain.

Dataset Details
- The SAL-Lightning dataset was collected during a study where 104 participants were asked to learn about the formation of thunder and lightning through web searches. The target variable is kg_mc, which represents the knowledge gain measured by the difference between post-test and pre-test multiple-choice scores.

For modeling purposes, we can convert this continuous knowledge gain variable into three classes:
- Low Knowledge Gain: Participants whose knowledge gain is below -0.5 standard deviations from the mean
- Moderate Knowledge Gain: Participants whose knowledge gain is between -0.5 and 0.5 standard deviations from the mean
- High Knowledge Gain: Participants whose knowledge gain is above 0.5 standard deviations from the mean

The dataset includes several types of features:
1. Participant Information: Demographics and cognitive abilities
2. Web Search Behavior: Session duration, pages visited, interactions
3. Derived Metrics: Calculated values based on other features
